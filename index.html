                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>World War II or the Second World War[b] was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast
                    majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of two opposing
                    military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participating countries invested all available
                    economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the distinction
                    between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic
                    bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was
                    by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities. Millions died
                    due
                    to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of
                    Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted
                    against German and Japanese leaders.</p>

                <h4>Start of World War II</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland and
                        the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September
                        1939. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese
                        War on 7 July 1937, or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September
                        1931. Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the
                        Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars
                        became World War II in 1941. Other theorized starting dates for World War II include the
                        Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. The British historian Antony Beevor views
                        the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces
                        of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939. Others view the Spanish Civil
                        War as the start or prelude to World War II.</li>

                <h5>End of World War II</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the
                        time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the
                        formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace
                        treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951. A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's
                        future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most
                        post, World War II issues. No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever
                        signed, although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the
                        Soviet, Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between
                        them.</li>
